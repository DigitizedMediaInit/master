#Digitized Media Initiative
============================

Welcome to the Digitized Media Initiative Github page. This repo has all of our free products on it, so feel free and download all you'd like.

The Wiki holds the documentation & getting started info for each of our resources, so we recommend going there and reading up.

**Please Note** that the products in this Git repository are for Developers and people with experience in PHP, HTML5, CSS3 & Javascript. You need to have a basic knowledge of each of those to work with things in this Repository.
